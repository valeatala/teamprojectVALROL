## BIG IDEA/GOAL

For our project, we decided to create a website that would help college students facilitate the way they cook meals. As college students ourselves, we are sometimes lacking creativity and tend to eat the same meals over and over again. Wanting to break this habit, we created a website that would give us ideas on recipes, with instructions on creative meals. We decided to take it one step further and add a dietary restrictions menu so people can exclude certain ingredients from the recipe. Also, we incorporated an OPEN AI menu where AI gives its opinion on the recipe. With the help from the SPOONACULAR API, we were able to make this website a reality, including pictures of the recipe and everything necessary for the user to follow instructions. 

## USER INSTRUCTIONS

For a user to be able to use and access our website, they will need to download our .py file as well as the html file, making sure to add the necessary API Keys. This will create a local address on their computer to access the website. In the website walkthrough folder, under the USER INSTRUCTIONS image, you can see the terminal ouput from the py code. Here, you click on follow link when you hover over the http link and it will redirect you to your browser and display the Recipe Recommender website. 

## RESULTS

We will include screenshots on our website and how it functions in the website walkthrough folder. 

In the STEP1 picture , you can see the main menu of our page. It the first text box,you write the main part of dish, or what you want to eat. Then you check the box if you have or don't have any dietary restrictions. 

In the STEP2 picture, this is where you write your desired meal. You could write "pasta", "salad", "meat", "chicken", "tacos". In this case, we wrote sandwich for the program to give us sandwich recommendations. 

In STEP3, you would add if you do or do not have dietary restrictions. If you do, click yes and choose a food restriction option. Select all applicable restrictions and proceed to click "Get Recipe Recommendation." If you do not have any restrictions, click No and then click  "Get Recipe Recommendation."

In STEP4, you will get a picture of the recipe recommendation, as well as the instructions to prepare it. 

In STEP5, you can see the opinion that OPENAI has given the user, as well as recommendations for any possible additions you can add to your meal. 

## Project Evolution/Narrative

We knew from a start that we wanted to add the option of dietary restrictions since it is something very important when searching for recipes. However, we later decided to add the OPEN AI feature, so the recipe had another opinion from AI. This feature adds more value to the website, as well as giving alternatives and further recommendations to the recipe.
